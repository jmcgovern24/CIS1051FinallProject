# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Batman The Animated Series Choose your own adventure

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I plan on making a visual novel based around batman the animated series. I will use art and clips in my game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use clips from the show to display actions and or scenes that result from the players choice. In addition I will use artwork as a way to speed up hte production process. My software will use ren.py to run the game. The player will have multiple choices for how they want the story to advance, using if statements and ren py. I am cinsidering have 4 different "games" and using monte carlo to randomly choose which one of the 4 games the player does so no play through will be the same.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

 I think I will have the ability to display visuals both static and moving.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Im hoping that I will be able to make a fully completed game, while not needing to be too long, I hope that you can do one succesful play through of the game with multiple possigle endings.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I can implent a monte carlo random picker between 4 diffenet sets of villians, there by making 4 different games so there is truly no similar play through.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how ren.py works, and how to implement my skills for a game rather than simple code. I will need to learn how to make a UI for ren.py and how to import visuals and different assets.
